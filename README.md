# What is Flutter?

Cross-platform programming toolkits are gaining popularity among programmers. Some of the reasons why these cross-platform app development frameworks are gaining traction are reusable UI blocks, reactive performance, and code usability across various platforms. Flutter by Google is one such popular framework for mobile app development.
When it comes to mobile apps, using Flutter is warranted in many circumstances because it has various advantages. Developers can use a hot-reload mechanism to make changes in real time. Flutter's Material Design widgets are used to create aesthetically stunning mobile apps. The performance, logical architecture, and detailed documentation of this open-source framework have all been lauded. Flutter is frequently recommended as a cross-platform tool for developing iOS and Android apps due to its efficiency and effectiveness.Built your app, with the best <a href="https://www.cronj.com/flutter.html" rel="nofollow">flutter development company</a>.

Features of Flutter

User-Interface Libraries

<a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> may create its own user interface components using UI libraries. As a result, rendering is sped up. An object's rendering process must be consistent between Android and iOS versions, as well as on an Android testing device.
This is made possible by Flutter's extensive set of UI libraries. In comparison to other programming languages, this feature also gives a certain level of interface security.

Hot Reload
Both Flutter and React have this capability. Flutter, on the other hand, is more strong, simple, and quick. The term "hot reload" refers to modifying the code at any time during the coding process and seeing the results as they occur.
Hot Reload in Flutter allows developers to correct issues, explore functionality, and add features whenever they want, with changes on the screen reflected in milliseconds.

Skia Graphics
Skia Graphics is used by Flutter to improve the graphics and appearance of its applications. Developers who use Flutter have simple access to this fantastic element, which helps them create a visually appealing user interface, resulting in a better user experience.

Skia graphics also includes useful tools for creating custom interface layouts. Skia graphics allow 2D graphics, which improves app-building imagination with cutting-edge animations and unrivaled API flexibility.

Native Features
Flutter has access to native functionality, which is one of its best qualities. This fantastic feature helps programmers by enhancing the app-building experience by providing third-party connectors, native codes, and programming interfaces for the platform.
Flutter also makes it simple for developers to use both the SDK and the native platform. Programming code can also be reused by programmers.

Advantages of Flutter

Programming code can also be reused by programmers.
Collection of stunning widgets
Flutter is a work of art, with a collection of fascinatingly created widgets. This is one of Flutter's most useful features, as it allows you to quickly create a highly functional application.It's also worth noting that designing customisable apps with Flutter is simple and takes only a few minutes. Dart, the programming language used to create Flutter, compiles directly to native code, therefore eliminating the requirement for Flutter to use OEM widgets.It reduces the time it takes for a program to start up and effectively reduces application performance difficulties.
Easy to learn
Flutter is a stunning toolkit written in Dart, a Java-like object-oriented programming language.You can easily change everything on the screen with this simple toolkit and create beautifully styled aesthetics and animations without affecting the application's functionality. Even if you are a complete beginner, Flutter is simple to master. It is suitable for beginners.
